                    <h4>Learn and Practice</h4>
                    <p>A mentor and friend of mine, who is a boss senior developer, once said
                        to me: <span><strong>"No one knows it all and if anyone says they do, they're
                             lying."</strong></span>
                    </p>
                    <p>Wherever you are on your path, be there. It will be more rewarding than rushing
                        yourself through.
                    </p>
                    <p>Learn and practice is how the <span style="color: #ff00ff; font-weight: bold;">magic
                    </span>happens.</p>

                    <p><span style="color: #4dffff; font-weight: bold;">Relax and breathe</span>. 
                        Problem solving is a big part of learning even for the experienced.
                    </p>
                    <p>Allow yourself to problem solve with a bit of playfulness in your approach.</p>
                    <p>Playing with your code to learn what happens teaches you a 
                        <span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">lot</span>.</p>
